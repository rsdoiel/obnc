DEFINITION extErr;
(*Output to the standard error stream*)

	PROCEDURE Char(ch: CHAR);
(*writes the character ch to the end of the error stream*)

	PROCEDURE String(s: ARRAY OF CHAR);
(*writes the null-terminated character sequence s to the end of the error stream (without 0X).*)

	PROCEDURE Int(i, n: INTEGER);
(*writes the integer i to the end of the error stream. If the textual representation of i requires m characters, i is right adjusted in a field of Max(n, m) characters padded with blanks at the left end. A plus sign is not written.*)

	PROCEDURE Hex(i: INTEGER);
(*writes the integer i to the end of the error stream as a zero-padded unsigned hexadecimal number with a leading space.*)

	PROCEDURE Real(x: REAL; n: INTEGER);
(*writes the real number x to the end of the error stream using an exponential form. If the textual representation of x requires m characters (including a two-digit signed exponent), x is right adjusted in a field of Max(n, m) characters padded with blanks at the left end. A plus sign of the mantissa is not written.*)

	PROCEDURE Ln;
(*writes an end-of-line symbol to the end of the error stream*)
